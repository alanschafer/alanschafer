    <h1>About This Site</h1>
    <p>
      This is more than just a GitHub Pages site. It's a creative ground zero for my work — a place where fiction, identity, and memory all blur into something raw and personal.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m Älan Schäfer. I don’t come here to explain everything — I come here to build something that resonates, quietly but deeply. The work speaks for itself, but this page exists to give a bit of grounding.
    </p>

    <p>
      The site launched with <strong><em>The 2ND Artifact</em></strong>, a surreal and fractured tale about trauma and what remains when memory fails. That’s the first piece — there are more artifacts coming.
    </p>

    <p>
      I chose GitHub as a medium not just because it's simple and fast, but because it's oddly fitting — a repository for things pulled apart and pieced together again. Code and narrative aren’t so different.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site will evolve. You’re welcome to watch it grow, share it, or reach out. I’m not building a brand. I’m building a signal.
